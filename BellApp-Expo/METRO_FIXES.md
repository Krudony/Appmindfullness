# Metro Bundler Performance Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified
1. **Cache rebuilding stuck on "Bundler cache is empty, rebuilding"** for 15+ minutes
2. **No metro.config.js file** - using default Expo settings
3. **No cache optimization** for Windows environment
4. **React Compiler** causing additional processing overhead

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Optimized metro.config.js
- Reduced maxWorkers to 1 for Windows compatibility
- Added memory cache configuration
- Optimized transformer settings
- Added asset extensions for better file handling

### 2. Cache Management
- Cleared all cache directories (.expo, node_modules/.cache, dist)
- Disabled automatic cache clearing on startup
- Used memory-based caching instead of disk-based

### 3. Server Configuration
- Started servers without --clear flag to avoid cache rebuilding
- Used multiple port options (8086, 8087)
- Added --no-dev option for faster startup

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue was the `--clear` flag forcing Metro to rebuild its entire cache from scratch, which:
- Required reprocessing all 45+ dependencies
- Rebuilt all React Native modules
- Reprocessed all font files and assets
- Took excessive time on Windows with React Compiler enabled

## Solutions Implemented
1. **Metro Configuration**: Created optimized metro.config.js with Windows-specific settings
2. **Cache Strategy**: Avoid full cache clears, use incremental updates
3. **Server Management**: Multiple server instances on different ports
4. **Performance Tuning**: Reduced worker count, memory caching

## Testing Recommendations
1. Use `npx expo start --port 8087` for normal development
2. Use `npx expo start --port 8086 --no-dev` for faster startup
3. Only use `--clear` when absolutely necessary (dependency changes)
4. Clear individual cache folders selectively when needed

## Current Status
- ✅ Metro config optimized
- ✅ Cache cleared and optimized
- ✅ Multiple servers starting successfully
- ⏳ Waiting for servers to complete initialization

## Next Steps
1. Verify server startup completion
2. Test Thai font rendering in app
3. Validate Temple theme colors
4. Check UI component layouts
